\usage{
print_c(x = read_clipboard(), sorted = TRUE, null = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector (defaults to reading the clipboard)}

\description{
Prints a vector to paste into an R script
}
\details{
This sorts (if set) and provides unique values for each element in \code{x} and
prints then as a call to \code{c}.  This can be useful for copying data that you
want to save as a vector in an R script.
The result is both called in \code{cat()} as well as copied to the clipboard.

\examples{
print_c(1:10)
print_c(letters[1:3])
print_c(month.abb)
