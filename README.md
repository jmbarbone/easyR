**J**ust **O**ther **R** **D**ata **A**nalytic **N**uggets

An R package with a set of general use functions for data analytics.
This is developed mostly for personal use and has no real *goal* other
than to limit the time I spend searching where I did that thing that I
think I could use again because it worked well but this problem might be
slightly different and I know I had to change it before.

Some parts happily ripped from and (hopefully) credited to others.

## Installation

You can the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/jmbarbone/jordan) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("jmbarbone/jordan")
```

## Example

~~We’re~~ I’m still working on this…

``` r
library(jordan)
```
