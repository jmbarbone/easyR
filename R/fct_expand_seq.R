#' Factor Expand by Sequence
#'
#' Expands an ordered factor from one level to another

#' @details
#' Defaults for `min_lvl` and `max_lvl` are the minimum and maximum levels in the ordered vector `x`.
#' This can be adjusted if we
#'
#' @param x An ordered factor
#' @param min_lvl The start of the level sequence
#' @param max_lvl The end of the level sequence
#' @param by Integer, number of steps in between
